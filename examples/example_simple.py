# import egi

"""
   The only real difference in the code between this example and the "multi-threaded" one
   are three lines:

   
   1. "import egi.simple as egi" vs "import egi.threaded as egi"
   2. "ns.connect('11.0.0.42', 55513)" vs. "ns.initialize('11.0.0.42', 55513)"

   -- in the beginning

   and
   3. "ns.disconnect()" vs "ns.finalize()"

   -- in the end of the file .

   The two last differences are left intentionally,
   to make a little bit more difficult to mix up the two variants of usage of the module .

#     the 'description' appears only in the log file, so it seems to exist for amusement mostly .
